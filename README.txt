Project: Prediction of the number of shares of articles on social networks.

The goal of this project was to predict for a given article, the number of shares on social networks. It was inspired by the paper mentioned below.
However, we decided to stay with a regression problem rather than switching to a classification problem as it was the case in the paper.

This project was realized in January 2019 during my MSc in Data Analytics & Artificial Intelligence at EDHEC.
It had the following objectives:
+ Use R and the related Data Science libraries such as tidyverse, glmnet, leaps or randomForest.
+ Use advanced machine learning algorithms such as Lasso regression, Ridge regression and Random Forest.
+ Use appropriate techniques to choose the best model (Cross Validation, BIC and AIC Criteria, RMSE)
